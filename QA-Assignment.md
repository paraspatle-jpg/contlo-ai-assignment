**Q1**  
In this case, if we retrain the model with n+1 features, we will get the similar weight for n+1 th feature and n th feature, given that we have a accurate Learning rate which will help model identify the importance of that feature correctly. An accurate learning rate will help model identify that n and n+1 are of same importance as they are duplicated so they will have same weights. Overall when comparing new weights and old weights, the new weights may vary from older weights to account for redundancy created by the duplication.

**Q2**
In the initial analysis, we encounter three options for comparison:

a. We have too little data to conclude that A is better or worse than any other template with 95% confidence.

b. E is better than A with over 95% confidence, B is worse than A with over 95% confidence. You need to run the test for longer to tell where C and D compare to A with 95% confidence.

c. Both D and E are better than A with 95% confidence. Both B and C are worse than A with over 95% confidence.

Z-scores for templates B, C, and D are all less than 1.96, indicating that we cannot be 95% confident that they are different from template A. However, the z-score for template E is greater than 1.96, suggesting that we can be 95% confident that it is better than template A.

Therefore, the accurate choice is:

b. E is better than A with over 95% confidence, B is worse than A with over 95% confidence. You need to run the test for longer to tell where C and D compare to A with 95% confidence.

**Q3**
The effect of features being sparse is that the computational cost of each gradient descent iteration of logistic regression is reduced, which results in the computational cost of **O(m*k)**. This is because in each iteration, we only need to compute the gradient with respect to the non-zero features. As a result, the computational cost is proportional to the number of non-zero features, which is much smaller than the number of total features.

**Q4**
1.  **Run V1 classifier on 1 Million random stories:**
    
    -  Advantages: This method leverages the existing V1 classifier to identify instances near the decision boundary, potentially providing nuanced examples for the model. However, its effectiveness relies on the assumption that V1 generalizes well to new data.
    -   Challenges: If V1 is already accurate, this approach might not yield diverse or informative examples. It could also be computationally expensive to identify cases near the decision boundary.
2.  **Get 10k random labeled stories:**
    
    -   Advantages: Introducing random diversity can help the model generalize better to various news story types. It ensures a balanced distribution of categories, enhancing the model's ability to handle different scenarios.
    -   Challenges: Randomly selected stories may not be relevant to the decision boundary or provide specific insights into classifier weaknesses. There's a risk of noise or irrelevant examples affecting the training process.
3.  **Pick a random sample of 1 million stories with wrong and farthest from the decision boundary:**
    
    -   Advantages: Focusing on cases where V1 is both wrong and far from the decision boundary can provide challenging examples for the model to learn from its mistakes. This may lead to improved performance in difficult scenarios.
    -   Challenges: Identifying instances where V1 is wrong and far from the decision boundary could be computationally expensive. Additionally, it assumes that learning from V1's mistakes is valuable for enhancing the classifier's accuracy.

**Theoretical Ranking Based on Accuracy Impact:** Considering the theoretical aspects, the ranking of the approaches based on potential impact on V2 classifier accuracy could be as follows:

1.  **Approach 3 (wrong and farthest from the decision boundary):**
    
    -   This method prioritizes challenging cases, offering opportunities for the model to learn and improve in areas of difficulty.
2.  **Approach 2 (random labeled stories):**
    
    -   While introducing diversity, this method might lack the specificity needed to address the model's weaknesses effectively.
3.  **Approach 1 (V1 classifier on 1 Million random stories):**
    
    -   This approach heavily relies on the existing V1 classifier and may not provide sufficient diversity if V1 is already accurate on the given data.

**Q5**

1.  **Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE):**
   It is a straightforward estimate based on the observed data, without considering any prior information.
    **Estimate:** The MLE for the probability of heads, denoted as $p$, is the fraction of times the coin comes up heads in the observed data.
       **MLE( p )=k/n​**

2.  **Bayesian Estimate:**
    It incorporates a uniform prior and provides a more robust estimate, especially when the number of observations is small.
     **Estimate:** The Bayesian estimate involves incorporating a uniform prior on $p$ from $[0,1]$ and finding the expected value of the posterior distribution.
 The posterior distribution is Beta-distributed, and the expected value of the posterior distribution is given by: 
 **Bayesian Estimate( p )=(k+1​)/(n+2)**
3.  **Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) Estimate:**
    It also incorporates the uniform prior but focuses on the mode of the posterior distribution.
     **Estimate:** Similar to the Bayesian estimate, the MAP estimate involves incorporating a uniform prior and finding the mode of the posterior distribution.
The MAP estimate is given by the mode of the Beta distribution, which corresponds to: 
**MAP( p )=k/n​**
